I have been watching videos from my code school for a while now, and recently a friend suggested a great resource to start learning C. So, don't worry... we are all just starting. Let's dive in to Sea C ( :P )

I come from a Python background, where we get a lot of spoon feeding (iykyk). My life was going well until I saw a Java snippet. But let's not talk about Java (no reason... I am just a hater...), but it was the first time I considered learning C and C++. I once heard someone say, "If you learn C++ first, Java seems a lot easier."
Weird reason, eh? but it got me started. I completed C++ tutorials many times, but it was all just the basics. I used to think that once I knew enough basics, legendary code that could save the world would manifest itself in my mind, but it never did. Maybe I never learned the basics well enough. Perhaps I should start over, or maybe that's not how it works. Let's not wait for the great Greek god (read: code) to reveal itself.

Breaking Out of the ( Tutorial ) Hell :)

So, after reading gfg docs of C++ a lot of times solving some easy peasy problems. I am back to square one. I decided to watch My Code School videos, I completed the basics practiced that understood whatever I could with my little brain. Then I got these amazing book and amazing site, I am using as resource here. And now I have decided to create small code blocks from C (some basic data structures from scratch like in python) for eg- lists, dictionaries etc. Then we'll move towards creating a little more complex structures... I do not know how to do it, so I'll be googling a lot. I will link all the resources I used in the end.

Prereq-

You must have a setup for C in your computer ready. Thank you :)

Hello Beloved Ritual :P

ps: i am dropping capital letters here...

create a c file using .c extension, let's say hello.c

just like you import in python, you include in c. first thing you do is import aka include standard library for input and output... that is 'stdio.h'

in python you do not need to create a main function to run it but in c you need to have a main function that covers your entire code in order to tell your computer that this code has to be executed

in python you need to call a function in order to execute it but in c the function would get automatically called when the file gets executed

when you run a python file, you just run it but to run a c file you first compile it and then run it

this is pretty much for now. let's start with our code-

// this is a comment

// this is import aka include statement... 

#include <stdio.h>

//looks a bit scary but don't be
/*it's just a hash and 2 angular brackets 
and lib name between those brackets... relax 
... and this is multi line comment */

// the we create our main function

int main(void) {

// you need to define type here... yes exactly- string, int, float etc
// cause it returns an int

prinf("Hello Beloved!\n"); // feel free to use name
/* this \n is the same as python just try printing without it 
and you'll know why we use it all the time 
and if you don't use semicolon it'll throw error, so better use it*/

return 0; 
// if no error in code it'll return 0
// else you'll spend evening debugging
}
// brackets are important in c code 
//just like indentation is important in python

i assume that you'll go through the resources provided and do stuff on own, also I am bad at teaching stuff so better teach yourself.
now let's move straight to the next next level thing~~
