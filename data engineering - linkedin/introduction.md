## Databases

- holds (large amount of) data
- organizes data 
- you can search through it easily using simple queries in SQL (dbms handles all this)
- databases or dbms are different from file systems, they are more organised and offer functionalities like search, replication and indexing
- Support for application and analysis
- classified into Structured, Semi- structured, unstructured data
- classified into SQL or NoSQL
- eg MySQL (SQL), PostgreSQL (SQL), MongoDB (NoSQL), Redis (No SQL)

### Database Schema
- schema describes relationship and structure between tables of a database
- 


## Processing Frameworks

- Data cleaning
- Data aggregation
- Data clustering
- Batch and strema processing
- eg Spark, Hive, Flinch and Kafka

## Automation and Scheduling

- Set up and manage workflows
- Plan jobs with specific intervals
- Resolve dependency requirements of job
- eg Airflow, Oozie, Luigi
